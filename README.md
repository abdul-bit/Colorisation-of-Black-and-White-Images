The project aims to colourise grayscale images
using Image Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
techniques. Colourising an image is one such problem that
doesnâ€™t have a clear cut solution or approach. A wide range
of authors have developed novel Convolution based approaches,
Auto-Encoder based models and so on for the same. This project
aims to enhance images using Filtering, Feature Extraction,
Colour Space mapping to effectively model the data being passed
to a Deep Learning Model to colourise the image.
